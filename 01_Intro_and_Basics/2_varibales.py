# varibales hold data for reusability purpose
# variable names should follow following rules:
# 1- name should start with an alphabet.
# 2- name should only have alphabets, numbers and underscores(_).
# 3- No special characters are allowed in variable names. 

# line01, line02, line03 are variables. and their data is printed in console or CLI using print().
# as variables are reusable, so line01 and line02 can be reused as header/footer

line01 = "*******************"      # header / footer
line02 = "*                 *"      # re-use
line03 = "*     WELCOME     *"

# print() function prints data in new line in console 
print(' ')
print(line01)
print(line02)
print(line03)
print(line02)
print(line01)
