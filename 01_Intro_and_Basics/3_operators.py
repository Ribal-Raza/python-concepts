Demonstration of Arithmetic, Comparison, Assignment, and Identity Operators

This code explores various operators in Python:
- Arithmetic operators for performing numerical calculations
- Comparison operators for comparing values
- Assignment operators for assigning and updating variables
- Identity operators for checking object identity

# Exercise Question: Find an Euclidian distance between (2, 3) and (10, 8)
# In (2,3), 2 is coordinate value on x-axis, 3 is coordinate value on y axis. Similar in (10,8)
# General formula to calculate Euclidian distance is
# distance = âˆš((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
# (square root of the sum of squared differences in coordinates)
# First lets store the values of location (2,3) and (10,8) in variables
x1 = 2
y1 = 3
x2 = 10
y2 = 8

# find the squared distances
x = (x2 - x1) ** 2
y = (y2 - y1) ** 2

# Now calculate the sum and then square-root of those squared distances
distance = (x + y) ** 0.5
print("Euclidian distance between (2,3) and (10,8) = ", distance)
